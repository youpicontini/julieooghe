Defaults the Image Link option to 'none' when adding a picture to a page or post.

== Description ==

By default, WordPress links images to themselves. A user sees that the image is a link, clicks it and they are then taken to a page of just the image. Then they click 'back' in their browser or move on to another site. 

You could manually remove the link, but that is a pain. Plus, when handing sites over to clients they shouldn't have to remember to remove it to have a great functioning site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'No Image Link' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to set any options? =

Nope. It's ready to go right out of the box.

= How do I get an image to link? =

When adding a photo, under the 'Image Link' option, choose 'File URL'

= Why do images already have links? =
WordPress' default setting is to link images to themselves.

= Does this remove links on existing images? =

No it does not. You will have to manually remove links off of existing images. You could also just install this plugin when first setting up the site.
